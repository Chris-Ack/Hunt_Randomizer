</div>  

## About The Project

This project is a simple tool to randomize the starting loadouts for the Videogame Hunt: Showdown by Crytek.
It is currently updated for Version 1.5 of the game. You can find the current version deployed at:

## Advisory

This was my very first project, and is very limited in scope & technologies used. I regularly use it as a basis for learning and applying newly learned technolgies.
This repository, however, is intended to stay as is - as a a reference point for myself of where I started out.

## Technologies used

- HTML & CSS
- Vanilla Javascript

(very impressive, I know.)
